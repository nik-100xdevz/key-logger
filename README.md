## Overview
This project is a basic keylogger written in C. It records keystrokes from the user and saves them to a file named `LOG.txt`. The program runs in the background with the console window hidden to remain stealthy.

---

## Features
- Logs all keystrokes, including special keys like `[BACKSPACE]`, `[ENTER]`, and `[TAB]`.
- Saves keystrokes to a specified log file (`LOG.txt` by default).
- Runs continuously in the background.
- Minimalistic implementation using Windows API.

---

## Requirements
- Operating System: Windows
- Compiler: GCC (MinGW) or any other C compiler that supports Windows API.
- Basic knowledge of C programming.

---

## Setup and Compilation
1. **Install GCC Compiler**:
   - For Windows, install MinGW: [MinGW Download](https://www.mingw-w64.org/).

2. **Download or Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/keylogger.git
   cd keylogger
   ```

3. **Compile the Code**:
   Use the following command to compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc -o keylogger keylogger.c -luser32
   ```

4. **Run the Program**:
   Execute the compiled program:
   ```bash
   keylogger.exe
   ```

---

## Usage
1. The program will start logging keystrokes as soon as it runs.
2. All keystrokes will be saved to `LOG.txt` in the same directory as the executable.
3. To stop the program, terminate it from the Task Manager.

---

## Technical Details
1. **Key Logging**:
   - The program uses the `GetAsyncKeyState` function from the Windows API to detect keystrokes.
   - Each key is mapped to either a printable character, a special key name, or its keycode.

2. **Stealth Mode**:
   - The `stealth` function hides the console window using the `FindWindowA` and `ShowWindow` functions.

3. **Log File**:
   - Keystrokes are written to a file named `LOG.txt`. The program appends new data to the file without overwriting existing logs.

4. **Supported Keys**:
   - Alphanumeric keys, special keys like `[BACKSPACE]`, `[TAB]`, and arrow keys, and other printable characters.
